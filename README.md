# Tandem Trivia

## About the Project:

Tandem Trivia is a console application developed for any user that enjoys trivia. Each round consists of 10 questions. Users will get their score at the end of the round.

## Getting Started

Instructions to run Tandem Trivia locally:

1. Clone Tandem Trivia by running the following command in your terminal: git clone https://github.com/danny128373/Code-Challenge.git

1. Open project with your favorite IDE.

## Built With

- Python 3.8 (created using only built-in libraries)

## Additional Features

Plenty of ideas came to my mind whenever I read the prompt. Something that stood out to me was to keep it simple, which is what led me to develop Tandem Trivia as a console application. Features that would make this an awesome app are:

- Making Tandem Trivia a web app, using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React for the front-end. Django and Python for the back-end. Playing to my strengths, but I always love learning new technologies!

- For variety in the questions, using a trivia API.

- Allowing users to challenge each other in a game of trivia.

- Adding high scores, for extra competitiveness.

### Final Thoughts

I had a lot of fun creating Tandem Trivia. Thank you for your consideration!
